# Mobile-Cart
WEB AND MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES CA Project

Mobile-Cart, is a Continuous Assessment (CA) project for the Web and Mobile Technologies course.

Repository Structure:

android/: Contains Android-specific project files, likely for building the mobile application on Android platforms.

assets/: Holds static resources such as images, fonts, or other media assets used in the project.

src/: Includes the source code for the application, possibly written in JavaScript or TypeScript, considering the presence of App.js and index.js.

App.js: The main entry point for the React Native application, responsible for rendering the primary components.

app.json: Configuration file for the application, defining settings like the app name, version, and other metadata.

eas.json: Configuration file related to Expo Application Services (EAS), used for building and deploying the app.

package.json: Lists the project's dependencies, scripts, and other npm-related configurations.

package-lock.json: Locks the versions of dependencies to ensure consistent installations across environments.

.gitignore: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore, preventing them from being tracked in version control.

Technologies Used:

The project utilizes a combination of JavaScript (82.2%) and Kotlin (17.8%). This suggests that the application might be built using React Native for cross-platform mobile development, with Kotlin components possibly integrated for native Android functionalities.

Setup Instructions:

To run the project locally:

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/aljojose2552/Mobile-Cart.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:


cd Mobile-Cart
Install Dependencies:

npm install
Start the Application:

npm start
This will initiate the development server. You can then use an emulator or a physical device to test the application.

Additional Notes:

Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

If the project uses Expo, you might need to install the Expo CLI:

npm install -g expo-cli
